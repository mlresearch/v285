abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
  various domains, including healthcare. However, their ability to effectively represent
  structured non-textual data, such as the alphanumeric medical codes used in records
  like ICD-10 or SNOMED-CT, is limited and has been particularly exposed in recent
  research. This paper examines the challenges LLMs face in processing medical codes
  due to the shortcomings of current tokenization methods. As a result, we introduce
  the UniStruct architecture to design a multimodal medical foundation model of unstructured
  text and structured data, which addresses these challenges by adapting subword tokenization
  techniques specifically for the structured medical codes. Our approach is validated
  through model pre-training on both an extensive internal medical database and a
  public repository of structured medical records. Trained on over 1 billion tokens
  on the internal medical database, the proposed model achieves up to a 23% improvement
  in evaluation metrics, with around 2% gain attributed to our proposed tokenization.
  Additionally, when evaluated on the EHRSHOT public benchmark with a 1/1000 fraction
  of the pre-training data, the UniStruct model improves performance on over 42% of
  the downstream tasks. Our approach not only enhances the representation and generalization
  capabilities of patient-centric models but also bridges a critical gap in representation
  learning models ability to handle complex structured medical data, alongside unstructured
  text.
