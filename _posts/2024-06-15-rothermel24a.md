abstract: 'In this paper, we explore the psychological relevance, similarity to brain
  representations, and subject-invariance of latent space representations in generative
  models. Using fMRI data from four subjects who viewed over 9,000 visual stimuli,
  we conducted three experiments to investigate this alignment. First, we assessed
  whether a linear mapping between the latent space of a generative mode, in this
  case a very deep VAE (VDVAE), and fMRI brain responses could accurately capture
  cognitive properties, specifically emotional valence, of the visual stimuli presented
  to both humans and machines. Second, we examined whether perturbing psychologically
  relevant dimensions in either the generative model or human brain data would produce
  corresponding cognitive effects in both systems — across models and human subjects.
  Third, we investigated whether a nonlinear mapping, approximated via a Taylor expansion
  up to the fifth degree, would outperform linear mapping in aligning cognitive properties.
  Our findings revealed three key insights: (1) the latent space of the generative
  model aligns with fMRI brain responses across all subjects tested (r   0.4, (2)
  perturbations in the psychologically relevant dimensions of both the fMRI data and
  the generative model resulted in highly consistent effects across the aligned systems
  (both the model and human subjects), and (3) a linear mapping, approximated using
  Ridge regression, performed as well as or better than all Taylor expansions we tested.
  Together, these results suggest a universal cognitive alignment between humans and
  between human-model systems. This universality holds significant potential for advancing
  our understanding of basic cognitive processes and offers promising new avenues
  for studying mental disorders.'
