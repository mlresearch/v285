abstract: Relative representations are an established approach to zero-shot model
  stitching, consisting of a non-trainable transformation of the latent space of a
  deep neural network. Based on insights of topological and geometric nature, we propose
  two improvements to relative representations. First, we introduce a normalization
  procedure in the relative transformation, resulting in invariance to non-isotropic
  rescalings and permutations. The latter coincides with the symmetries in parameter
  space induced by common activation functions. Second, we propose to deploy topological
  densification when fine-tuning relative representations, a topological regularization
  loss encouraging clustering within classes. We provide an empirical investigation
  on a natural language task, where both the proposed variations yield improved performance
  on zero-shot model stitching.
