abstract: Neural responses encode information that is useful for a variety of downstream
  tasks. A common approach to understand these systems is to build regression models
  or decoders that reconstruct features of the stimulus from neural responses. Here,
  we investigate how to leverage this perspective to quantify the similarity of different
  neural systems. This is distinct from typical motivations behind neural network
  similarity measures like centered kernel alignment (CKA), canonical correlation
  analysis (CCA), and Procrustes shape distance, which highlight geometric intuition
  and invariances to orthogonal or affine transformations. We show that CKA, CCA,
  and other measures can be equivalently motivated from similarity in decoding patterns.
  Specifically, these measures quantify the average alignment between optimal linear
  readouts across a distribution of decoding tasks. We also show that the Procrustes
  shape distance upper bounds the distance between optimal linear readouts and that
  the converse holds for representations with low participation ratio. Overall, our
  work demonstrates a tight link between the geometry of neural representations and
  the ability to linearly decode information. This perspective suggests new ways of
  measuring similarity between neural systems and also provides novel, unifying interpretations
  of existing measures.
