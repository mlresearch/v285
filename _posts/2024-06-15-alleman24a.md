abstract: Humans occasionally reason using logic and abstract categories, and yet
  most state of the art neural models use continuous distributed representations.
  These representations are impressive in their learning capabilities, but have proven
  difficult to interpret, or to compare to biological representations. But continuous
  representations can sometimes be interpreted symbolically, and a distributed code
  can seem to be constructed by composing abstract categories. We ask whether it is
  possible to detect and get back this structure, and we answer that it sort of is.
  The demixing problem is equivalent to factorizing the data into a continuous and
  a binary part $\mathbf{X}= \mathbf{W}\mathbf{S}^T$. After establishing some general
  facts and intuitions, we present two algorithms which work on low-rank or full-rank
  data, assess their reliability on extensive simulated data, and use them to interpret
  neural word embeddings where we expect some compositional structure. We hope this
  problem is interesting and that our simple algorithms provide a promising direction
  for solving it.
