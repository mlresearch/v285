abstract: Artificial neural network-based vision encoding models have made significant
  strides in predicting neural responses and providing insights into visual cognition.
  However, progress appears to be slowing, with many encoding models achieving similar
  levels of accuracy in predicting brain activity. In this study, we show that encoding
  models of human fMRI responses are highly vulnerable to small-scale adversarial
  attacks, revealing differences not captured using predictive accuracy alone. We
  then test adversarial sensitivity as a complementary evaluation measure and show
  that it offers a more effective way to distinguish between highly predictive encoding
  models. While explicit adversarial training can increase robustness of encoding
  models, we find that it comes at the cost of brain prediction accuracy. Our preliminary
  findings also indicate that the choice of model features-to-brain mapping might
  play a role in optimizing both robustness and accuracy, with sparse mappings typically
  resulting in more robust encoding models of neural activity. These findings reveal
  key vulnerabilities of current models, introduce a novel evaluation procedure, and
  offer a path toward improving the balance between robustness and predictive accuracy
  for future encoding models.
