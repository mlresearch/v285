abstract: 'The remarkable performance of transformer models in both linguistic and
  real-world reasoning tasks coupled with their ubiquitous use has prompted much research
  on their alignment with brain activations. However, there remain some unanswered
  questions: what aspects of these models lead to representational alignment- the
  input modality or the training objective? Moreover, is the alignment limited to
  modality-specialized brain regions, or can representations align with brain regions
  involved in higher cognitive functions? To address this, we analyze the representations
  of different transformer architectures, including text-based and vision-based language
  models, and compare them with neural representations across multiple brain regions
  obtained during a visual processing task. Our findings reveal that both training
  data modality and training objective are important in determining alignment, and
  that models align with neural representations within and beyond the modality-specific
  regions. Additionally, the training modality and objectives seem to have an impact
  on alignment quality as we progress through the layers, suggesting that multimodal
  data along with a predictive processing objective may confer superior representational
  capabilities compared to other training objectives.'
