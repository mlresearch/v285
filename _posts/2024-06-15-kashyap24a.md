abstract: Content-addressable memories such as Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) have
  been studied as mathematical models of the auto-association and storage/retrieval
  in the human declarative memory, yet their practical use for large-scale content
  storage faces challenges. Chief among them is the occurrence of meta-stable states,
  particularly when handling large amounts of high dimensional content. This paper
  introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded
  neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable
  states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero
  association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation
  of requiring access to partial content in the same domain. Experimental results
  demonstrate substantial reduction in meta-stable states and increased storage capacity
  while still enabling perfect recall of a significantly larger number of inputs advancing
  the practical utility of associative memory networks for real-world tasks.
