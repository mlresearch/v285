abstract: Multi-view data from the same source often exhibit correlation. This is
  mirrored in correlation between the latent spaces of separate variational autoencoders
  (VAEs) trained on each data-view. A multi-view VAE approach is proposed that incorporates
  a joint prior with a non-zero correlation structure between the latent spaces of
  the VAEs. By enforcing such correlation structure, more strongly correlated latent
  spaces are uncovered. Using conditional distributions to move between these latent
  spaces, missing views can be imputed and used for downstream analysis. Learning
  this correlation structure involves maintaining validity of the prior distribution,
  as well as a successful parameterization that allows end-to-end learning.
