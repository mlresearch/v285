abstract: We compared neural responses to naturalistic videos and representations
  in deep network models trained with static and dynamic information. Models trained
  with dynamic information showed greater correspondence with neural representations
  in all brain regions, including those previously associated with the processing
  of static information. Among the models trained with dynamic information, those
  based on optic flow accounted for unique variance in neural responses that were
  not captured by Masked Autoencoders. This effect was strongest in ventral and dorsal
  brain regions, indicating that despite the Masked Autoencodersâ€™ effectiveness at
  a variety of tasks, their representations diverge from representations in the human
  brain in the early stages of visual processing.
