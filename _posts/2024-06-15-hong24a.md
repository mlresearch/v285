abstract: When trained on biased datasets, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often make
  predictions based on attributes derived from features spuriously correlated with
  the target labels. This is especially problematic if these irrelevant features are
  easier for the model to learn than the truly relevant ones. Many existing approaches,
  called debiasing methods, have been proposed to address this issue, but they often
  require predefined bias labels and entail significantly increased computational
  complexity by incorporating extra auxiliary models. Instead, we provide an orthogonal
  perspective from the existing approaches, inspired by cognitive science, specifically
  Global Workspace Theory (GWT). Our method, Debiasing Global Workspace (DGW), is
  a novel debiasing framework that consists of specialized modules and a shared workspace,
  allowing for increased modularity and improved debiasing performance. Additionally,
  DGW enhances the transparency of decision-making processes by visualizing which
  features of the inputs the model focuses on during training and inference through
  attention masks.  We begin by proposing an instantiation of GWT for the debiasing
  method. We then outline the implementation of each component within DGW. At the
  end, we validate our method across various biased datasets, proving its effectiveness
  in mitigating biases and improving model performance.
