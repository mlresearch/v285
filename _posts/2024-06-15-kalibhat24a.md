abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables training performant models using
  limited labeled data. One of the pillars underlying vision SSL is the use of data
  augmentations-perturbations of the input which do not significantly alter its semantic
  content. For audio and other temporal signals, augmentations are commonly used alongside
  format transforms such as Fourier transforms or wavelet transforms. Unlike augmentations,
  format transforms do not change the information contained in the data; rather, they
  express the same information in different coordinates. In this paper, we study the
  effects of format transforms and augmentations both separately and together on vision
  SSL. We define augmentations in frequency space called Fourier Domain Augmentations
  (FDA) and show that training SSL models on a combination of these and image augmentations
  can improve the downstream classification accuracy by up to 1.3% on ImageNet-1K.
  We also show improvements against SSL baselines in few-shot and transfer learning
  setups using FDA. Surprisingly, we also observe that format transforms can improve
  the quality of learned representations even without augmentations; however, the
  combination of the two techniques yields better quality.
