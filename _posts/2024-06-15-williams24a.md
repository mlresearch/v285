abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) and representational similarity analysis
  (RSA) of dissimilarity matrices are two popular methods for quantifying similarity
  in neural representational geometry. Although they follow a conceptually similar
  approach, typical implementations of CKA and RSA tend to result in numerically different
  outcomes. Here, I show that these two approaches are largely equivalent once one
  incorporates a mean-centering step into RSA. This connection is quite simple to
  derive, but appears to have been thus far overlooked by the community studying neural
  representational geometry. By unifying these measures, this paper hopes to simplify
  a complex and fragmented literature on this subject.
