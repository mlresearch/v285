abstract: Classical methods in Digital Communication rely on mixing transmitted signals
  with carrier frequencies to eliminate signal distortion through noisy channels.
  Drawing inspiration from these techniques, we present an adapter network that enables
  CLIPSeg, a text-conditioned semantic segmentation model, to communicate point prompts
  to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in the positional embedding space. We showcase
  our technique on the complex task of Deformable Linear Object (DLO) Instance Segmentation.
  Our method combines the strong zero-shot generalization capability of SAM and user-friendliness
  of CLIPSeg to exceed the SOTA performance in DLO Instance Segmentation in terms
  of DICE Score, while training only 0.7% of the model parameters.
