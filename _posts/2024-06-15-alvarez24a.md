abstract: Understanding the alignment between human and machine perceptual decision-making
  is a fundamental challenge. While most current vision deep neural networks are deterministic
  and produce consistent outputs for the same input, human perceptual decisions are
  notoriously noisy. This noise can originate from perceptual encoding, decision processes,
  or even attentional fluctuations, leading to different responses for the same stimulus
  across trials. Thus, any meaningful comparison between human-to-human or human-to-machine
  decisions must take this internal noise into account to avoid underestimating alignment.
  In this paper, we introduce the \textbf{decision-margin consistency metric}, which
  draws on signal detection theory, by incorporating both the variability in decision
  difficulty across items and the noise in human responses. By focusing on decision-margin
  distances-continuous measures of signal strength underlying binary outcomes-our
  method can be applied to both model and human systems to capture the nuanced agreement
  in item-level difficulty. Applying this metric to existing visual categorization
  datasets reveals a dramatic increase in human-human agreement relative to the standard
  error consistency metric. Further, human-to-machine agreement showed only a modest
  increase, highlighting an even larger representational gap between these systems
  on these challenging perceptual decisions. Broadly, this work underscores the importance
  of accounting for internal noise when comparing human and machine error patterns,
  and offers a new principled metric for measuring representational alignment for
  biological and artificial systems
