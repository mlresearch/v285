abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to become an essential tool in supporting
  clinical decision-making processes, offering enhanced diagnostic capabilities and
  personalized treatment plans. However, outsourcing medical records to train ML models
  using patient data raises legal, privacy, and security concerns. Federated learning
  has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative ML, meeting healthcare institutions’
  requirements for robust models without sharing sensitive data and compromising patient
  privacy. This study proposes a novel method that combines federated learning (FL)
  and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using electroencephalography
  (EEG) signals across multiple medical institutions. Our approach enables multiple
  hospitals to jointly train a shared GNN model on their local EEG data without exchanging
  patient information.  Specifically, we address a regression problem by predicting
  the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a key indicator of stroke
  severity. The proposed model leverages a masked self-attention mechanism to capture
  salient brain connectivity patterns and employs EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations
  of the neurological states after a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings
  from four institutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting
  NIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\approx$ 3.0). This
  demonstrates the method’s effectiveness in providing accurate and explainable predictions
  while maintaining data privacy.
