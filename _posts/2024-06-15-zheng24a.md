abstract: Delayed generalization, also known as "grokking", has emerged as a well-replicated
  phenomenon in overparameterized neural networks. Recent theoretical works associated
  grokking with the transition from lazy to rich learning regime, measured as the
  change in the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) from its initial state. Here, we present
  an empirical study on image classification tasks. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that
  the NTK deviates from its initial state significantly before the onset of grokking,
  i.e., before test performance increases, suggesting that rich learning does occur
  before generalization. To explain this difference, we instead look at the representational
  geometry of the network, and find that grokking coincides in time with a rapid increase
  in manifold capacity and improved effective geometry metrics. Notably, this sharp
  transition is absent when generalization is not delayed. Our findings on real data
  show that lazy and rich training regimes can become decoupled from sudden generalization.
  In contrast, changes in representational geometry remain tightly linked and may
  therefore better explain grokking dynamics.
