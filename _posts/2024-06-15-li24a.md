abstract: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are devastating psychiatric disorders
  that can be difficult to adequately classify, considering commonalities that make
  it difficult to distinguish between them using conventional classification approaches
  based on low-order functional connectivity. Recently, high-order functional connectivity
  has emerged as a promising method for diagnosing psychiatric illnesses, and this
  research applied multiple strategies for distinguishing schizophrenia and bipolar
  disorder using features taken from dynamic high-order functional connectivity and
  divisive normalization. The approach that produced the greatest results combined
  dynamic high-order functional correlations and divisive normalization to examine
  patterns of intrinsic connection time courses collected from resting-state fMRI.
  Our findings indicate that resting-state fMRI-based dynamic high-order functional
  connectivity and feature enhancement through divisive normalization classification
  hold significant promise for improving the accuracy of psychiatric diagnoses. Moreover,
  to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to integrate divisive normalization
  with functional connectivity in fMRI.
